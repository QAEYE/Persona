<p style="color: var(--text-secondary);">
Persona is a personal project designed to bring together everything essential in one app, aiming to make you distraction-free. Whether it’s capturing moments, storing important documents, jotting down notes, or curating blogs for focused reading, Persona allows you to organize it all in one place.
</p>

<h2 style="color: var(--text-primary);">Features</h2>

<h3 style="color: var(--text-primary);">1. Clicks</h3>
<p style="color: var(--text-secondary);">
Capture and preserve your precious moments. With the <strong>Clicks</strong> feature, you can take pictures and save them directly in the app, making sure your memories are organized in one safe place.
</p>

<h3 style="color: var(--text-primary);">2. Books</h3>
<p style="color: var(--text-secondary);">
Add books or documents that are important to you. Although the feature to read them directly within the app is coming soon, for now, you can store them and access them easily.
</p>

<h3 style="color: var(--text-primary);">3. Notes</h3>
<p style="color: var(--text-secondary);">
The <strong>Notes</strong> section lets you create notes with titles for quick access to important information. Use this section to jot down thoughts, reminders, or anything you need to stay organized.
</p>

<h3 style="color: var(--text-primary);">4. Blogs</h3>
<p style="color: var(--text-secondary);">
Add blogs you want to read and stay focused on essential content. Whether it's Paul Graham essays, philosophy, literature, or science, this feature allows you to collect valuable reading material without getting distracted by unnecessary content.
</p>

<h3 style="color: var(--text-primary);">5. Texts (Coming Soon)</h3>
<p style="color: var(--text-secondary);">
This feature is planned to consolidate messages across multiple platforms into one place, allowing you to view and respond to texts without switching between apps. It’s still under development, and I’m exploring the best way to implement it.
</p>

<h3 style="color: var(--text-primary);">Upcoming Features</h3>
<ul style="color: var(--text-secondary);">
  <li><strong>Music</strong>: A new feature that will let you add a few tracks to help you focus and get into the flow without distractions.</li>
  <li><strong>Notify</strong>: To stay up to date with what you want to be. For me, being updated with competitive programming contests is crucial, so I'm planning to add this feature too.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="color: var(--text-primary);">Purpose</h2>
<p style="color: var(--text-secondary);">
The goal of <strong>Persona</strong> is to simplify life by providing a unified space where you can store essential tasks and information, freeing you from the clutter of switching between multiple apps. This app aims to bring everything that matters to you in one place.
</p>

<h2 style="color: var(--text-primary);">Future Plans</h2>
<p style="color: var(--text-secondary);">
This is a personal project that I plan to release on the Play Store, but let's see what time holds!
